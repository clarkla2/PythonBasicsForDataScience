## Dedication

Thanks, Dad, for giving me a computer in 1984! 
Sorry I didn't listen and learn C back then. 
This one is for you.

Thanks, Mom, for teaching me to use an IBM Selectric and to balance your checkbook. The first taught me the power of a machine. The latter set me up to recognize the beauty of a spreadsheet and a formula
.

Thanks, Scott, for all the encouragment. Here we go!

 

## Lessons Learned

- When you create a repository and it offers you the chance to make a README file, do it. It's not so intuitive to add it afterwards.
- When you are using the notebooks for this class, click on the cells with code. Hit Shift + Enter AND keep your eyes peeled on the line right below the cell. That's where your "result" appears. I kept thinking it was going to run and print somewhere else. I thought it wasn't working!
- When you can't figure out what your GitHub "Repo" is, it's your Repository. Seems obvious now!
- The Root File is just the main branch/generic/first level folder inside your repository.


## FAQ

#### Why?

A burning desire to demonstrate that *you
 can indeed teach a mature female dog new tricks.*

#### But who cares about a beginner's work?

Many sites try to lower the barriers to beginning coding, but there is still so much jargon. 
Maybe this will help someone else start.
